# Python-Trading-Probability
### Python projects for financial data analysis and probability experiments

A collection of Python projects for financial data analysis, probability experiments, and trading strategies / analysis.  
This repository is structured into two main areas: probability/statistics experiments and trading/analysis projects.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

### **1. Probability Experiments** (`probability_experiments/`)  
Beginner-friendly notebooks demonstrating foundational concepts in probability and statistics applied to trading:  

- [01_probability_basics.ipynb](probability_experiments/01_probability_basics.ipynb)  
  Covering expected value, independent events, complement rule, binomial probability, conditional probability, Bayes theorem, variance, and standard deviation.  

- [02_statistics_basics.ipynb](probability_experiments/02_statistics_basics.ipynb)  
  Covering mean, median, variance, standard deviation, covariance, correlation, normal distribution, Z-scores, confidence intervals, Law of Large Numbers (LLN), and Central Limit Theorem (CLT).  

- [03_risk_metrics.ipynb](probability_experiments/03_risk_metrics.ipynb)  
  Covering Maximum Drawdown, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Kelly Criterion, and Gamblerâ€™s Ruin.  

- [04_simulations_monte_carlo.ipynb](probability_experiments/04_simulations_monte_carlo.ipynb)  
  Monte Carlo simulations for trading strategies, cumulative PnL visualization and the distribution of outcomes.


### **2. Trading and Analysis** (`trading_analysis/`)  
Notebooks applying probability, statistics, and risk metrics to real trading strategies:  

- [btc_eth_analysis.ipynb](trading_analysis/BTC_vs_ETH_analysis.ipynb)  
  Comparison and analysis of BTC and ETH. 

- [btc_alpha_strategy.ipynb](trading_analysis/Alpha_BTC_strategy.ipynb)  
    Alpha-generating strategy on BTC using a 3x2 EMA setup and volatility filter, with grid search optimization to find the best EMA parameters.
